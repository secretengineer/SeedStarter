Assemble the necessary hardware components: a Raspberry Pi, a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22), a light sensor (Tsl2561), a soil temperature sensor (LM35), a pH sensor (PhSensor), a relay module (SRD-05VDC-SL-C), and appropriate power supply.

Connect the hardware components to the Raspberry Pi. For example, you can use the following GPIO pin connections:

DHT22 sensor: GPIO17
Tsl2561 sensor: GPIO4
LM35 sensor: GPIO27
PhSensor: GPIO22
Relay module: GPIO18
Write the Python program for the control system. Here's an example code snippet that reads data from the sensors and controls the relay module based on the temperature and humidity:
